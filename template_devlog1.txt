devlog--
Use keyboard shortcut to jump to end,
 replicate entry template,
 modify appropriately.

zone of reflection--
Flesh out each category whenever necessary, appropriate.
 Need not be fully filled in until end of project,
 but best done as you go along.

OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we were evalutaing negative numbers, we kept on getting an index out of range when multiplying and dividing. However, it turned out that we forgot the ~ symbol in those two methods. So we made a global number variable instead so an error like this won't happen again. 


UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None currently.

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yet to  happen.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No changes in design.
 
LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Still on the journey.
